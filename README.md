# Online-help-desk-using-JAVA
An online help desk system built with Java Servlets, JDBC, and following the MVC architecture efficiently manages user inquiries and support requests. Servlets handle user requests, JDBC facilitates database connectivity for data management, and MVC ensures a clear separation of concerns for modularity and scalability.
